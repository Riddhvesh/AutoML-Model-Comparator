# AutoML-Model-Comparator
This project is an AutoML system that automatically trains and compares multiple classification models on a heart disease prediction dataset. It loads patient health data, preprocesses it using standard scaling, and uses LazyPredict to train dozens of machine learning models at once. Each model is evaluated on metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and runtime. The results are displayed in a sorted table and visualized in a bar chart to highlight the top-performing models. This tool helps quickly identify the best model for a classification problem without writing manual code for each one. It is built with Python, scikit-learn, LazyPredict, and Seaborn, and can be extended with features like model saving or a web interface. Due to a file handling error, the .ipynb notebook could not be uploaded to this repository.
